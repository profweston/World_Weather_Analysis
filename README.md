# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This project involved collecting data through API's and organizing it into various graphic representations. Three products were produced.

1. Weather Database

A request of 2000 random latitudes and longitudes identified over 700 cities. The following weather data was requested for each city: maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed and weather description.

2. Vacation Search

Input boxes were devloped to gather preferences for minimum and maximum temperatures for potential vacation locations. Then using gmaps API, a hotel was found near each city that satisified these inputs. A map with markers was produced.

3. Vacation Itinerary


Choosing four cities, a potential itinerary for a vacation was developed. A marker layer map with driving route between cities was created and hotel information was included with each marker.
